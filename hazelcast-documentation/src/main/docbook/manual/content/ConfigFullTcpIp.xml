    <title>Configuring Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster</title>
    <para>If multicast is not prefered way of discovery for your environment, then you can configure Hazelcast for full
        TCP/IP cluster. As configuration below shows, while
        <literal>enable</literal>
        attribute of
        <literal>multicast</literal>
        is set to false,
        <literal>tcp-ip</literal>
        has to be set to true. For the none-multicast option, all or subset of cluster members' hostnames and/or ip
        addreses must be listed. Note that all of the cluster members don't have to be listed there but at least one of
        them has to be active in cluster when a new member joins. The tcp-ip tag accepts an attribute called
        "conn-timeout-seconds".
        The default value is 5. Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IP's listed and members
        can not properly build up the cluster.
