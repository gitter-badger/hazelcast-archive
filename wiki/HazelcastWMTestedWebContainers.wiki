#summary HazelcastWM Tested Web Container List
== Tested Web Containers ==

Hazelcast Webapp Manager is designed to work with any application server that supports Servlet spec. 2.3 or higher and constantly tested on following containers:
    * Tomcat5.0/5.5/6.0
    * Jetty 5.1.12/5.1.14/6.1.10/6.1.11
    * Weblogic 9.0/10
    * Websphere 6.1
    * GlassfishV3
    * Caucho Resin 3.0.26

Any application server that uses Tomcat or Jetty as its container such as JBoss and Geronimo should work just fine.
