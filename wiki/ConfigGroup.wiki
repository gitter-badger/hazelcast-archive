#summary How to separate clusters
== Creating Separate Clusters ==

By specifying group-name and group-password, you can separate your clusters in a simple way. dev group, production group, test group, app-a group etc... a jvm can only participate in one group and it only joins to its own group, does not mess with others.

{{{
<hazelcast>
	<group>
		<name>dev</name>
		<password>dev-pass</password>
	</group>
	...
	
</hazelcast>
}}}
