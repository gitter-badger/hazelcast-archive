#summary JEE Integration resource adapter configuration
== Resource Adapter Configuration ==

Deploying and configuring Hazelcast resource adapter is no different than any other resource adapter since it is a standard `JCA` resource adapter but resource adapter installation and configuration is container specific, so please consult your J2EE vendor documentation for details. Most common steps are:

    # Add the `hazelcast.jar` to container's classpath. Usually there is a lib directory that is loaded automatically by the container on startup.
    # Deploy `hazelcast-ra.rar`. Usually there is a some kind of deploy directory. Name of the directory varies by container.
    #  Make container specific configurations when/after deploying `hazelcast-ra.rar`. Besides container specific configurations, `JNDI` name for Hazelcast resource is set.
    # Configure your application to use the Hazelcast resource. Updating `web.xml` and/or `ejb-jar.xml` to let container know that your application will use the Hazelcast resource and define the resource reference.
    # Make container specific application configuration to specify `JNDI` name used for the resource in the application.
