#summary Dummy Java Client
== Java Client ==

You can do almost all hazelcast operations with Java Client. It already implements the same interface.
You must include hazelcast-client.jar into your classpath.

{{{
    import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
    import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient;

    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.Collection;


    HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient("dev", "dev-pass", "10.90.0.1", "10.90.0.2:5702");
    //All Cluster Operations that you can do with ordinary HazelcastInstance
    Map<String, Customer> mapCustomers = client.getMap("customers");
    mapCustomers.put("1", new Customer("Joe", "Smith"));
    mapCustomers.put("2", new Customer("Ali", "Selam"));
    mapCustomers.put("3", new Customer("Avi", "Noyan"));

    Collection<Customer> colCustomers = mapCustomers.values();
    for (Customer customer : colCustomers) {
         // process customer
    }
