#summary How to configure Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster
== Configuring Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster ==
If multicast is not prefered way of discovery for your environment, then you can configure Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster. As configuration below shows, while `enable` attribute of `multicast` is set to false, `tcp-ip` has to be set to true. For the none-multicast option, all or subset of cluster members' hostnames and/or ip addreses must be listed. Note that all of the cluster members don't have to be listed there but at least one of them has to be active in cluster when a new member joins.
