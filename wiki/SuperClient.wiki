#summary Super Clients
== Super Clients ==

Super Clients are members with no storage. If `-Dhazelcast.super.client=true` JVM parameter is set, then the JVM will join the cluster as a 'super client' which will not be a 'data partition' (no data on that node) but will have super fast access to the cluster just like any regular member does.
