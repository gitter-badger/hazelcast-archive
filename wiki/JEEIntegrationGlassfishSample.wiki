#summary How to deploy Hazelcast resource adapter into Glassfish v3
== Sample Glassfish v3 Web Application Configuration ==

    # Place the `hazelcast-<version>.jar` into `GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/ext/` directory.
    # Place the `hazelcast-ra-<version>.rar` into `GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/` directory
    # Add the following lines to the `web.xml` file.
      {{{
      <resource-ref>
      	<res-ref-name>HazelcastCF</res-ref-name>
      	<res-type>com.hazelcast.jca.ConnectionFactoryImpl</res-type>
      	<res-auth>Container</res-auth>
      </resource-ref>
      }}}      
          	
Notice that we didn't have to put `sun-ra.xml` into the rar file because it comes with
the `hazelcast-ra-<version>.rar` file already.


If Hazelcast resource is used from EJBs, you should configure `ejb-jar.xml` for resource reference
and `JNDI` definitions, just like we did for `web.xml`.
