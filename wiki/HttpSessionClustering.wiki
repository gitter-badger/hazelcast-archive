#summary Http Session Clustering with HazelcastWM
*This documentation is out-dated and will be removed soon. Official Hazelcast documentation can be found at http://www.hazelcast.com/docs.jsp.

== Requirements ==

    * Target application or web server should support Java 1.5+
    * Target application or web server should support Servlet 2.3+ spec
    * Session objects that needs to be clustered have to be Serializable
 
== Installation ==

To cluster your web application, all you have to do is to use `clusterWebapp.bat` or `clusterWebapp.sh` scripts that comes with the Hazelcast distribution.

{{{
> clusterWebapp.bat war-file-path|ear-file-path
}}}
e.g
{{{
> clusterWebapp.bat myapp.ear
> Done. New clustered application at C:\hazelcast-1.1\clustered-myapp.ear
}}}      

`clusterWebapp.bat|sh` will not modify the war/ear files passed in. Instead, it will create a new war/ear file and name it as `clustered-<app-file-name/>`. 

You can pass multiple war and ear files. Besides if you pass `-apps-sharing-sessions` as an argument then your applications will be able to share the same sessions. If `-apps-sharing-sessions` argument is used, `hazelcast.jar` file will not be placed into the war/ear files so  you need to add `hazelcast.jar` into your application server's classpath.

{{{
> clusterWebapp.bat myapp.ear app1.war app2.war app3.war -apps-sharing-session
}}}
