==EC2 Auto Discovery==

Hazelcast supports EC2 Auto Discovery as of 1.9.4. It is useful when you don't want or can't provide the list of possible IP addresses.
Here is a sample configuration:

===Configuration===
Disable join over multicast and tcp/ip and enable aws. Also provide the credentials. By default Hazelcast will search for other members on default(us-east-1) region. To set other regions the region tag can be used.  

{{{
        <join>
		<multicast enabled="false">
			<multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
			<multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
		</multicast>
		<tcp-ip enabled="false">
			<interface>192.168.1.2</interface>
		</tcp-ip>
                <aws enabled="true">
                        <access-key>my-access-key</access-key>
                        <secret-key>my-secret-key</secret-key>
                        <region>us-west-1</region> !--This is optional, default is us-east-1 --
                </aws>
	</join>
}}}

===Required Libraries===
First you need to add hazelcast-cloud.jar into your classpath. Note that it is also bundled inside hazelcast-all.jar.
hazelcast-cloud module depends on Amazon AWS SDK so you will need to have aws-java-sdk and the libraries that it depends on. AWS SDK 1.0.0 and above should work just fine. For the
libraries that sdk depends on please check out [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk/1.2.1  aws-java-sdk maven repository details] .
