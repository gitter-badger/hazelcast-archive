#summary Cluster-wide Id Generator
== Id Generator ==

Hazelcast IdGenerator  creates cluster-wide unique IDs. Generated IDs are long  type primitive values between 0  and `Long.MAX_VALUE`  . Id generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`  . Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start from 0  again.
